# Eat-Da-Burger!

Eat-Da-Burger! is the latest restaurant app that lets you keep track of the burgers you eat or want to eat. Just input the name of the burger you want to eat in the field. The name will then be added to the left of the app. You then have the option to either "Devour it!" or "Delete" it. When you choose to devour a burger, the burger will be moved over to the right of the app. This lets you know that the burger has been devoured. Deleting the burger will remove it from the app completely.

Enjoy!
